Vibe: Clean hustle, inner fire, outer calm, disciplined ambition

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a COMPLETE vision board with NO text or images cut off at any edges
- Ensure ALL elements are FULLY VISIBLE within the square canvas boundaries
- Leave adequate margin/padding around all edges (minimum 40 pixels)
- Center the composition perfectly - nothing should be cropped or partially visible
- ALL text must be completely readable and fully within the frame
- ALL images and graphics must be entirely visible, not cut off at top, bottom, or sides
- Design should fit perfectly within a 1024x1024 square with proper spacing
- Every element should be strategically placed to be completely viewable
