Create a bold, empowering, and luxurious digital vision board using the exact same collage layout, visual style, orientation, and energetic aesthetic as the reference image. The board should have a modern, high-vibe, gender-neutral energy with bright lighting, contrast-rich tones, and confident affirmation overlays. Use a harmonious color palette that matches {USER_AESTHETIC} throughout the collage. Blend photo cutouts, sticker graphics, and stylish typography overlays.

Match these key design traits from the reference:
- Mixed fonts (bold serif, elegant script, and all-caps modern fonts)
- Use of affirmations layered over lifestyle photos
- Cutout-style visuals representing success, achievement, and lifestyle goals
- A balance between luxury, success, self-worth, and personal power
- Keep a similar element density, positioning, and text-image ratio
