# Verbose Logging Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

## üîç **Problem Identified**
The verbose logging messages you were seeing:
```
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:apscheduler.executors.default:Running job "NotificationSystem._check_habit_reminders..."
```

Were caused by the global logging configuration in `core/serp_search.py` that was set to `INFO` level, making all libraries show detailed logs.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Fixed SERP API Logging**
- Updated `core/serp_search.py` to use module-specific logging instead of global configuration
- No longer affects the entire application's logging level

### 2. **Created Centralized Logging Configuration**
- New file: `core/logging_config.py`
- Controls verbosity of different libraries:
  - **httpx**: WARNING+ only (no more API request logs)
  - **apscheduler**: ERROR only (no more job execution logs)
  - **urllib3/requests**: WARNING+ only
  - **OpenAI/Pinecone**: WARNING+ only
  - **App loggers**: Controlled by LOG_LEVEL environment variable

### 3. **Added Logging Control via Environment**
- Added `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` to your `.env` file
- Options available:
  - `DEBUG`: Show all logs (for development)
  - `INFO`: Show app info + warnings/errors
  - `WARNING`: Show only warnings and errors (recommended)
  - `ERROR`: Show only errors

### 4. **Updated App Initialization**
- Modified `app.py` to configure logging before importing other modules
- Ensures quiet mode is set up from the start

## üß™ **Test Results**
Before fix:
```
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:apscheduler.executors.default:Running job "NotificationSystem._check_habit_reminders..."
```

After fix:
```
‚úÖ Memory operation completed with reduced logging
```

The OpenAI API calls still happen (memory system working), but without the verbose logs!

## üéõÔ∏è **How to Control Logging**

### For Production (Quiet):
```bash
# In .env file
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
```

### For Development (More Details):
```bash
# In .env file  
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### For Debugging (Full Details):
```bash
# In .env file
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### For Ultra-Quiet Mode:
```python
# In your code
from core.logging_config import set_quiet_mode
set_quiet_mode()
```

## üìã **What You'll See Now**
- ‚úÖ **No more** verbose httpx API request logs
- ‚úÖ **No more** apscheduler job execution logs  
- ‚úÖ **Only** important warnings and errors
- ‚úÖ **App functionality** unchanged (Pinecone, memory, search all working)
- ‚úÖ **Cleaner terminal** output for better development experience

## üîß **Files Modified**
1. `core/serp_search.py` - Fixed global logging configuration
2. `core/logging_config.py` - New centralized logging control
3. `app.py` - Added logging setup on startup
4. `.env` - Added LOG_LEVEL configuration option

**Your terminal output should now be much cleaner while maintaining all functionality!** üéØ
