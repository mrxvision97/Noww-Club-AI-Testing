   âœ… Episodic memory storage working
   âœ… Persona created from authentic data
   âœ… Prompt uses user's specific content
   âœ… No generic template content
   âœ… User-specific creative elements included

âœ… EXAMPLE AUTHENTIC PERSONALIZATION:
Instead of generic black/gold luxury template:
- User mentioned "vibrant orange, electric blue" â†’ Uses these colors
- User mentioned "photography, nature walks" â†’ Shows these activities  
- User mentioned "mentoring, inspiring others" â†’ Reflects these goals
- User mentioned "creative spark, innovation" â†’ Uses these symbols

âœ… PRODUCTION READY:
The system now creates vision boards that users will genuinely connect with because they reflect their actual responses, dreams, and personality - not generic template content.

Each vision board is a true reflection of the individual user's authentic intake responses, captured through episodic memory and transformed into personalized visual manifestation.

ðŸŽ¨ RESULT: Users get vision boards that truly represent THEM and their unique journey, making them fall in love with their personalized creation.
